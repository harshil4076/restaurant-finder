solution if you had more time? If you didn&#39;t spend much time on the coding test
then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

          The process looked as follows
                a.Create Wireframe using draw.io 
                b. Created the UI , css and react app setup.
                c. Redux Store Setup
                d.Simaltaniously wrote tests in Jest and Enzyme.
          I would also add auto complete using the api/stats which would give suggestions 
          of the city as the user types.

chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you&#39;ve used
it.

# How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever
    had to do this?

Answer: I would start with the images getting loaded and minify that. 
        The module bundler helps a lot with performance.
        We could use frameworks like nextJs for Server Side Rendering.
# How would you improve the API that you just used?
 Answer: I would definately add more filters for query requests and write more extensive error reporting.
